            <h2>Welcome Scouts of all ages</h2>
            <p>To ensure that everyone is able to maintain social distancing requirements, we are currently limiting scout/youth camping reservations to a reduced number of units/attendees.</p>
            <p>Each Unit will be responsible for ensuring compliance with current State, Local, and Organizational guidelines for group activities.</p>
            <p>For scouts that wish to take an aircraft ride as part of the scout activity, the BSA requires that each Unit complete and submit a BSA Flying Plan Checklist to Council.</p>
            <p>Along with the application, the Unit must submit a signed BSA Activity Consent Form for each scout that will take a flight.</p>
            <p>Scouts are welcome to camp at the Flying Circus Aerodrome year-round. We do have a few rules regarding camping at the airport, these are mainly for the safety of the campers and the pilots using the airport:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Permission for camping is required, and can be obtained by contacting the FCA Scouting coordinator, Joe Callen (<a href="mailto:Scouts@FlyingCircusAirshow.com">Scouts@FlyingCircusAirshow.com</a>), or the Flying Circus (<a href="mailto:Info@FlyingCircusAirshow.com">Info@FlyingCircusAirshow.com</a>).</li>
                <li>There will be no camping on the runway/hanger side of the fence.</li>
                <li>Please do not enter any of the hangers/buildings on the airport without the approval of a Flying Circus Staff member.</li>
                <li>Adult supervision and caution are required when using any of the fields on the runway/hanger side of the fence - Remember there are two grass runways, and you may be right in the middle of one and not even realize it. While airport traffic is rare on non-airshow days, planes do use the airport.</li>
                <li>Campfires are permitted, but they must be supervised by an adult or a Scout with the "Fire'em" Chit (or Girl Scout equivalent).</li>
                <li>If your troop is not planning to stay for the airshow, please plan to depart by 11:00 AM on Sunday.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are both restrooms and several Port-a-John's on the airport, and there are water spigots behind the snack bar and behind the restroom building. There are also ample picnic tables.</p>
            <p>To show our support for scouting, we have instituted special discount admissions for Scouts and their leaders. These rates will be in effect throughout the airshow season for Uniformed Scout Groups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daisy/Brownie/Girl Scouts (3-12 yrs.) --- $10.00</li>
                <li>Cub/Webelos/Boy Scouts (3-12 yrs.) --- $10.00</li>
                <li>Girl Scouts/Boy Scouts/Adult Leaders --- $15.00</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All Scouts and Leaders should be in Full Uniform (per your BSA/GSA units standards).</p>
            <p class="note">NOTE: Scout Group Rates Are Not Available during the Annual Hot Air Balloon Festival Weekend</p>
            <p>Please have one of your leaders collect the admission fees and bring them to the gate, along with the count of leaders/scouts from your unit.</p>
            <p>The Airshow starts at 2:30 pm (gates open at 11 am) and the show ends at 4:30 pm. Airplane rides are available before and after the show (purchase ride tickets at the gift shop).</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please send me an email.</p>
